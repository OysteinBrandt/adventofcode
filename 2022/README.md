## About Advent of Code
- https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.<br><br>
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.<br><br>
If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to share it with others, or directly via [PayPal or Coinbase](https://adventofcode.com/2022/support).
